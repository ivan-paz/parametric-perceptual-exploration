# parametric-perceptual-exploration
Explore a parametric space while taking data, and use those information to generate structured patterns

This repository contains the necessary material to perform perceptual exploration of the different combinations of parameters of a generative system. <br />  
The main idea was inspired by the way in which we write sound generator units (or processors) and then, we tweak its parameters listen to the changes in the output until we find an interesting result.<br / >  

Following the previous idea, we can split the aural material into different classes, each one intended for a particular purpose. For example, we can create a class containing the outputs that we would like to use in a particular part of a piece. Or we can consider three classes, beeing part A part B and part A', and label the outputs according to the part in wich we want to use them.

Please get in touch for any doubts, comments or if this repo inspires you something interesting. Have fun!
